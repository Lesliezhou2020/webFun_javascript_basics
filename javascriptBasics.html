                <H2>JavaScript Basics</H2>
                <p>It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use[1]. JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js[2], or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.</p>

                        <p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
                            JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. 
                            JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable.
                             A variable must have a unique name.<span>var x</span>
                        </p>  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
                            Variable assignment is usually the most important step when using a variable. 
                            Here the variable is assigned data which is a value using the assignment operator "=".
                            <span>var x=10</span>
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><a href="#">Data Type</a>
                            Data types are divided into two groups: 
                            Primitive data types - includes byte , short , int , long , 
                            float , double , boolean and char. Non-primitive data types - such as String,<span>42</span>
                             Arrays and Classes.<span>{first-name:'jane',last -name'Doc'}</span>
                        </p>

                        <p><a href="#">Conditions</a>
                            A conditional sentence is based on the word 'if'. 
                            There are always two parts to a conditional sentence â€“ one part beginning with 'if' 
                            to describe a ...
